### Nice to meet you!
I am a recent computer science graduate from Liberty University with a degree in cyber-security. I was born and raised in Florida with a passion for tech and all the opportunities that it offers us. Now based in Wilmington, North Carolina, I am constantly looking for opportunities to challenge myself and expand my skillset. 

While my career has only recently started, I have already had the pleasure to work on multiple projects during my college career, including the opportunity to work with the DHS! Feel free to check out some of my previous projects and experiences over at my website! I look forward to the opportunity to work with you.

**Some Fun Facts About Me:**
- I am passionate about software engineering, cyber-security, and database administration!
- When I first started pursuing programming, I learned C++ as my first language.
- I've been obsessed with the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the original Iron Man released.
- I love playing all kinds of games - both physical and digital.
- I have a passion for traveling around the world and enjoying new experiences!... although my wallet disagrees.

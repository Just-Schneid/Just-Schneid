### Nice to Meet You!
I am a computer science graduate from Liberty University with a degree in cyber-security. I was born and raised in Florida with a passion for tech and all the opportunities that it offers us. Now based in Wilmington, North Carolina, I am constantly looking for opportunities to challenge myself and continuously expand my skillset.

I have already had the pleasure to work on several large-scale projects throughout both my collegiate and professional career, including the opportunity to work with the Department of Homeland Security! I currently work as a software engineer for a healthcare management company in the area, and I am working to constantly improve the tools that our healthcare employees use on a daily basis so that they can deliver better care to our patients across the southeastern United States! Feel free to check out some of my previous projects and experiences over at my website! I look forward to the opportunity to work with you.

**Some Fun Facts About Me:**
- I am passionate about all things software engineering, cyber-security, and database administration!
- When I first started coding, C++ was my first language that I learned.
- I've been obsessed with the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the original Iron Man released.
- I love playing all kinds of games - both tabletop and virtual.
- I have a passion for traveling around the world and enjoying new experiences!... although my wallet tends to disagree.
